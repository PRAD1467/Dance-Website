// include ../static/style.css as in app.js we set views as directory so it will look for style and index in views so we change it to static where is our files located and iam putting that file code commenting here becaude syntax is different and we get error in files
// nav#navbar.top.firstClass.secondClass 
// | this
// these two lines of code teel that in nav bar there are three classes top, firstClass, secondClass and id is navbar and we want this written should be print to browser so we use pipe(|).
// we created base, home , contact pug files to understand template inheritane. So that we don't need to rewrite code just take them and made necessary changes.
// here we take base as a file and just inheriting the tags from it and putting the particular files folder to contact , home files to change it .
// we took the same style file but it is not recommended to use the same file style should be different so that each page looks unique & beautiful.
